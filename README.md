## Hey there üëê

My name is Zofia, although I prefer to be called Zosia (pronounced Zoh-see-ah).
I am a second year master student at KAIST, majoring in Industrial Design.
I research Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) under the guidance of professor Andrea Bianchi.
My interest is specifically in digital fabrication, with previous projects focusing on 3D printing. üíª
I am interested in exploring opportunities for computational fabrication for crafters, specifically crocheters. üß∂

I received my undergraduate degree in Industrial Design and Computer Science (double major) from KAIST with an excellence in leadership.
I graduated from number one high school in Poland, [XIV LO im. Stanislawa Staszica](https://staszic.waw.pl/), where I studied in Matex (class with an university-level based mathematics curriculum) profile.
I have been a passionate programmer since childhood. My favourite (and most familiar programming) language is C++, which I started to participate in competetive programming competitions: Junior Informatics Olympiad in Poland (ranking in top10), and Informatics Olympiad in high school.
Besides C++, I am also comfortable with python, having used it during my internship at [NoMagic](https://nomagic.ai/), where I implemented an error-handling feature for an Intelligent Robot solutions. 
Attending KAIST, I planned to major in Computer Science only, but my passion for solving real-world problems and helping people has led me to discover possibilities within Industrial Design department. I connect both of my passions for people and technology by researching HCI.
In my free time, I love to crochet and do puzzles. üß©

üéâ Fun fact: I am an introvert (INFJ), but I love to talk a lot.
